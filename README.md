# üîÄ Merge Sort in C++

> A simple and efficient implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm using C++.  
> Designed for learning purposes and beginner-friendly sorting algorithm practice.

---

## üìã Features
- üì§ Outputs the sorted numbers in ascending order

## üß† What is Merge Sort?

> Merge Sort is a **divide-and-conquer** algorithm that splits the array into halves,  
> recursively sorts each half, and then **merges** the two sorted halves into one.

### üîç Key Concepts:
- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Best, Average, Worst: `O(n log n)`
- **Space Complexity**:  
  - `O(n)` (because of additional arrays used for merging)
- **Stable Sort**: Yes
- **Comparison-based**: Yes
- **Efficient for large datasets**
